# Anchor Test UI

Testing Anchor programs can be lenghty and overwelming So we thought of a Cool Way of Testing Anchor program without writing an Testing Code. We have created a Web Application which allows you to enter your anchor program's IDL and the application create's a GUI for interacting with it. This project is Still in it's early phase as we have just started it a Few days ago.
